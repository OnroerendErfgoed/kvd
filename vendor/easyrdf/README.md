EasyRdf
=======
EasyRdf is a PHP library designed to make it easy to consume and produce RDF. It
was designed for use in mixed teams of experienced and inexperienced RDF
developers. It is written in Object Oriented PHP.

During parsing EasyRdf builds up a graph of PHP objects that can then be walked
around to get the data to be placed on the page.

Data is typically loaded into a EasyRdf_Graph object from source RDF documents.
The source document could either be an RDF file on the web or the output of a
Construct or Describe SPARQL query from a triplestore.

### Example ###

    $foaf = new EasyRdf_Graph("http://www.aelius.com/njh/foaf.rdf");
    $me = $foaf->primaryTopic();
    echo "My name is: ".$me->get('foaf:name')."\n";
